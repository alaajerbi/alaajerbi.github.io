                    <p>I have 3+ years of experience with Javascript, with a special attention for building not just functional, but beautiful User Interfaces that give delight to the user. I work mostly with <a href="https://reactjs.org">ReactJS</a> for web applications and <a href="https://reactnative.dev">React Native</a> for mobile, but always ready to learn anything to get the job done. </p>

<p>Apart from coding, I also design prototypes for web or mobile applications, helping bring your idea to life.</p>
